# blackjack

The game is played with a single deck of 52 cards

The dealer hits on a soft 17 (a hand with an ace valued at 11)

The player can hit, stand, or double down (double their bet and receive one more card)

- If the player goes over 21, they lose immediately (bust)
- If the player stands, the dealer hits until they have at least 17 points
- If the dealer busts, the player wins
- If both the player and dealer have the same number of points, it's a push (tie) and the player's bet is returned
- If the player has more points than the dealer, the player wins and their bet is returned + an amount equal to the bet
